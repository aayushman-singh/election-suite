**The Problem:**
India's elections face growing threats from misinformation, accessibility barriers for marginalized communities, and security vulnerabilities. Tribal and rural voters often lack digital literacy and infrastructure, while voters with disabilities struggle with accessibility, and isolated populations can't easily reach polling stations.

**Our Solution:**
A comprehensive, AI-driven election integrity suite that protects democracy at every stage:

Architecture:
Identity Layer:

Dev team has access to fact-checker real IDs (stored encrypted, need multi-sig to decrypt)
Public sees constant pseudonyms for fact-checkers
Voters completely anonymous post-vote, but authenticated pre-vote
Party/organization accounts are ALWAYS labeled and flagged

Verification Flow:

Post → AI scans for claims → flags for community review
Community notes style voting on veracity
Full evidence chain stored: original claim + IPFS hash → community votes → timeline → final state (if reached)
Blockchain records: claimHash → [verdictHistory] → current_state
Disagreements stay visible as "Contested - X% say true, Y% say false"

Voting Privacy Model:

Vote cast → encrypted → tallied → appears in user's dashboard as "Voted in: Class President 2025" (no choice revealed)
Vote choice locked from user view for 90 days post-election (configurable)
Transparent tallying process with audit logs

Content Moderation:

AI first-pass (hate speech, violence, spam)
Warning labels on unverified claims
Human mod team for appeals
Political party content auto-flagged on upload with "Paid/Affiliated Content" banner
